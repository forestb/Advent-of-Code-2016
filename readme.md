# Advent Of Code 2016
An exercise in exercising.

Interested in doing the AoC yourself?  [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016).

I may have approached some problems incorrectly (utlimately or initially), but for my own efficacy, I'll summarize and provide some information about the problem and it's parts.

I decided I wanted to make this a public repo after completing Day 8. The code should be relatively clean for Day 7 and beyond, but I'm not interested in refactoring the first 6 projects at the moment.

- **Day 1:  No Time for a Taxicab  (Grid traversal)**
- **Day 2: Bathroom Security (Grid traversal)**
- **Day 3: Squares With Three Sides (Array traversal)**
  - I remember thinking the Part 2 was *way* more difficult for me than it should have been.
- **Day 4: Security Through Obscurity (String manipulation?)**
- **Day 5: How About a Nice Game of Chess? (MD5 Hash library)**
  - Fun!
- **Day 6: Signals and Noise (Array manipulation)**
- **Day 7: Internet Protocol Version 7 (Pattern detection)**
  - This was the first time I had decided to use a `HashSet` object to solve a problem.  This was a fun problem and I'm relatively happy with the solution.
- **Day 8: Two-Factor Authentication (2D Grid manipulation)**
  - Part 1
    - I felt good about the solution. I've had to somewhat reacquaint myself with 2D array traversal (row/column and i/j indexing)
  - Part 2
    - Very cool; I had already made a `Print();` method and noticed something looked interesting about the results from part 1.
- **Day 9: Explosives in Cyberspace (Decompress encoded strings)**
  - Part 1 
    - ***Not*** solved in a "good" way. Woops.
  - Part 2 
    - Best solved recursively. Part 1 could not be extended for this. I'm happy with my solution for Part 2.
